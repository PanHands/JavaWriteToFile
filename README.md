This is a single class that can take a few numerical arguments and a file pathway, and write the contents of those arguments into a txt file. 
It is a modified design of a class I previously wrote. This iteration is more modular and should be able to work with other programs.
The class is short and simple to modify.

NOTE: There are potential internalization issues with byte to string conversions.
